Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a game that I have been working on for the past
few months. I had developed the initial prototype somewhere in the middle of 2021,
but was buisy with other things for most of the year. However, the idea stuck.

There were some very interesting interactions that kept arising out of a fairly
straightforward system, and the was very exciting for me as a designer. Now, at the
start of 2022, I have decided that I would like to commit myself to this game for
the next six to eight months, with the goal of having a pitchable slice of the game
ready.

Based on that, I will either be releasing it right then, or hopefully, find some way
to gather enough interest that I can continue working on this, and making it the best
possible game that I can make.

This website is meant to be a progress log, as well as a motivational boost for myself.

Here goes nothing.
