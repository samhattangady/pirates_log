      <description>Did some more work on the solver. It can now solve real levels. Still struggles on levels with more commands though.</description>

      <description>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a game that I have been working on for the past few months. I had developed the initial prototype somewhere in the middle of 2021, but was buisy with other things for most of the year. However, the idea stuck.
There were some very interesting interactions that kept arising out of a fairly straightforward system, and the was very exciting for me as a designer. Now, at the start of 2022, I have decided that I would like to commit myself to this game for the next six to eight months, with the goal of having a pitchable slice of the game ready.</description>

      <description>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a puzzle game about a bunch of boys working on their startup. They believe that they have found their own little niche in the pirate industry, a product that will turn an entire industry on its skull. Do they have what it takes? The only way to find out is by setting sail on the voyage along with them.
The bulk of the puzzles in the game are presented on a grid.</description>
