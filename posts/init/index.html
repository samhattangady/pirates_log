    <p>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a game that I have been working on for the past
few months. I had developed the initial prototype somewhere in the middle of 2021,
but was buisy with other things for most of the year. However, the idea stuck.</p>
<p>There were some very interesting interactions that kept arising out of a fairly
straightforward system, and the was very exciting for me as a designer. Now, at the
start of 2022, I have decided that I would like to commit myself to this game for
the next six to eight months, with the goal of having a pitchable slice of the game
ready.</p>
<p>Based on that, I will either be releasing it right then, or hopefully, find some way
to gather enough interest that I can continue working on this, and making it the best
possible game that I can make.</p>
<p>This website is meant to be a progress log, as well as a motivational boost for myself.</p>
<p>Here goes nothing.</p>
