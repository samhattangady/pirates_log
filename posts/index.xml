      <description>First, let me share one of the latest builds that I have.
 This is what I have been working on a lot. Trying to get the game into a place where it feels like a real toy. Where the buttons will make clack-clack sounds. Something about it feels very playful. And that&amp;rsquo;s what has got me thinking.
I got into puzzle game development largely because of the thinky-puzzle-games discord. It&amp;rsquo;s a great place, with a lot of fascinating and inspiring people doing exciting work.</description>

      <description>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a game that I have been working on for the past few months. I had developed the initial prototype somewhere in the middle of 2021, but was buisy with other things for most of the year. However, the idea stuck.
There were some very interesting interactions that kept arising out of a fairly straightforward system, and the was very exciting for me as a designer. Now, at the start of 2022, I have decided that I would like to commit myself to this game for the next six to eight months, with the goal of having a pitchable slice of the game ready.</description>
