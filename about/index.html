<h1> about </h1>
      <p>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions is a puzzle game about a bunch of boys
working on their startup. They believe that they have found their own
little niche in the pirate industry, a product that will turn an entire
industry on its skull. Do they have what it takes? The only way to find
out is by setting sail on the voyage along with them.</p>
<p>The bulk of the puzzles in the game are presented on a grid. Ships and other
such actors are placed on the grid. The player can then place commands for
these ships to pick up. All commands need to be placed before the start of
the simulation. Once the simulation starts, the ships start moving forward
until the interact with commands, other ships, or any other items present
in the game.</p>
<p>All these tokens, how they interact with other tokens, the playing space,
as well as time itself present a system that has a lot of potential to be explored.
This game is an attempt to explore these systems.</p>
<p>For the graphics, we are looking to use a variation of vector graphics. The idea
is that all the shapes that are drawn on screen are understood by the engine itself,
so there is a lot of scope for varying shapes and making the most use of this.
I hope to write a post about the art of the game soon, including the custom tool that
has been written to facilitate this.</p>
<p>The game is being developed in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, using SDL and OpenGL.</p>
<p>Development began somewhere in the middle of 2021, and was on-and-off for
the rest of the year. Development picked up again in earnest near the end
of 2021, and moving forward, the effort will hopefully remain continuous.</p>
<p>Up until now, the development is being mostly led by me, Samarth.</p>
